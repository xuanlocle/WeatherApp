# Weather Application
Android weather application implemented using the MVVM pattern, Kodein, Retrofit , LiveData, ViewModel, Coroutines, Room. WeatherApp fetches data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to provide real time weather information. 

# Features

## Architecture
The architecture of this application relies and complies with the following points below:
* Pattern [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)(MVVM) which facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface.
* [Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/) which help to keep the application robust, testable, and maintainable.

## Technologies used:

* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) a REST Client for Android which makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice.
* [Kodein](https://kodein.org/di/) for dependency injection.
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) to handle data in a lifecycle-aware fashion.
* [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started/) an adaptable system of guidelines, components, and tools that support the best practices of user interface design.
* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) used to manage the local storage i.e. `writing to and reading from the database`. Coroutines help in managing background threads and reduces the need for callbacks.
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) persistence library which provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) which helps to write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.

## Installation
WeatherApp requires a minimum API level of 23. Clone the repository. You will need an API key i.e. `API_KEY` from [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/) to request data. If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key. 

In your project's root directory, inside the `local.properties` file (create one if unavailable) include the following lines:

````properties
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"

````
